# Tools in Data Science : Project 1

* **Approach :** Using the GitHub API, I collected data on all users based in Beijing who have over 500 followers, along with their repositories. The data was saved in CSV format. I automated this process by creating a Python script with the requests library to fetch and store the data efficiently.

* **Analysis Insights :** While Python and JavaScript are common, Liu Xinyu ('liuxinyu95') showed the highest average star count per repository. A few users with fewer public repositories still had high average stars, suggesting a strong emphasis on project quality over quantity among popular developers.


* **Actionable Recommendation :** Beijing developers should focus on high-quality projects in Python and JavaScript, prioritizing documentation and user engagement. Exploring Rust projects could also help them attract dedicated followers, as Rustâ€™s high star count per repository shows strong community interest.
