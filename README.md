# Tools in Data Science : Project 1

* **Approach :** Using the GitHub API, I collected data on all users based in Beijing who have over 500 followers, along with their repositories. The data was saved in CSV format. I automated this process by creating a Python script with the requests library to fetch and store the data efficiently.

* **Analysis Insights :** JavaScript stands out as the primary language, with 6,089 repositories, followed by Python with 2,177 repositories. Additionally, the user “cfenollosa” has repositories with an exceptionally high average star count, suggesting significant popularity and community engagement. Vim Script emerged as the language with the highest average stars per repository.


* **Actionable Recommendation :** Developers in Barcelona may benefit by focusing on JavaScript and Python, which are widely used locally. To increase visibility, developers could create well-documented, community-focused projects, as demonstrated by top users with popular repositories.
